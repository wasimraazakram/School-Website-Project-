<h2 class="style3">HISTORY</h2>
<p>

The Jesuit Fathers and Brothers, in collaboration with a competent and dedicated lay staff, run St. Xavier’s School. Founded by St. lgnatius Loyola in the 16th century, the Society of Jesus has been associated with education throughout the world and notably in India. Since the earliest history Jesuit education has been inspired by a vision of man drawn from the life and teachings of Jesus Christ who has always been respected and admired by the people of India. St. Francis Xavier arrived in India in 1541. He died off the China coast in 1552. Amidst his almost incredible journeying in India and as far as Japan and the “Spice Island” or Eastern Indonesia, carrying Christ’s message of divine love and mercy, he found time to organize the first Jesuit school in India, His name lives on today in many schools, colleges and institutes of advanced training throughout the subcontinent just as his example of self-sacrificing love continues to inspire his fellow Jesuits.
Founded in 1940, St. Xavier’s is meant primarily for Catholics but is open to all, irrespective of religion, caste or community who would be trained to lead lives in keeping with the school motto For God and Country. Through the years it has built up a reputation for excellence in the education it imparts to boys/girls from in and around Patna. Its earnest intent is that the young men/women it prepares for the world may be able to distinguish themselves by their selfless service, a service inspired by the reality that as children of one Father we are all brothers and sisters responsible for one another. As an institution, St. Xavier’s continually strives to adapt itself to the needs and aspirations of the people among whom it works. Students will be admitted in as long as they show promise of becoming young men/women and citizens who will live up to the school’s aims and ideals.</p>

  <h2 class="style3">PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE </h2>
  With a new session, a new beginning and things will change. When Jawaharlal Nehru addressed the nation for the first time, little did we know that in a short span of about 70 years, our country will move forward to become one of the fastest growing economies and the most promising countries of the world.

  History is testimony to the fact that John F. Kennedy believed in new beginnings. His conviction that man had to tread the space for gaining knowledge of the far and beyond, at a time when space travel was unthought-of.
  
  With the turn of the calendar, the commitment to take the school to greater heights is more firmly established. New energies, new blood pumped into the system brings a fresh thought and a paradigm shift is being envisaged. Undoubtedly, this would require hard work, perseverance and a firm belief in the adage ‘Yes, We Can’, but we are committed and with a firm resolve, would surge forth to accomplish the vision of our preceding stalwarts who set the tone and tempo for performance.
  
  Any institution works smoothly and attains recognition and its place on the ladder with team-work and mutual trust. The parent body is an integral part of this trajectory. Their continued involvement, collaboration and motivation to the student community will lead to the accomplishment of personal as well as school goals. Newer and more innovative ways of collaboration need to be evolved and implemented. To attain this, the institution is committed.
  
  To the students, I have but one message to give. Dream big and work towards your goal. We, at Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram, strive to see your beginnings culminate in unparalleled success. And, success comes to those who are good human beings while at the same time excel in scholastic as well as co-scholastic fields. You stepped into the portals of this great institution with fresh thoughts, lofty aims, high hopes, and exalted aspirations. I assure you that your ambitions will be accomplished through the able guidance of the highly accomplished and experienced faculty of teachers. In return, the school seeks superior ethics, positive attitude, social and moral values and discipline. Remember, you are the torchbearers and your first and foremost duty is to follow the footsteps of the trailblazer alumni yet chart a unique course for yourself.
  
  To conclude, I would like to reiterate my belief with this quote by Henry Ford: If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself. So let’s all join hands to take off on this journey to higher orbits of excellence.

<br>
  With best wishes to all
