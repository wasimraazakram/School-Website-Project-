The Jesuit Fathers and Brothers, in collaboration with a competent and dedicated lay staff, run St. Xavier’s School. Founded by St. lgnatius Loyola in the 16th century, the Society of Jesus has been associated with education throughout the world and notably in India. Since the earliest history Jesuit education has been inspired by a vision of man drawn from the life and teachings of Jesus Christ who has always been respected and admired by the people of India. St. Francis Xavier arrived in India in 1541. He died off the China coast in 1552. Amidst his almost incredible journeying in India and as far as Japan and the “Spice Island” or Eastern Indonesia, carrying Christ’s message of divine love and mercy, he found time to organize the first Jesuit school in India, His name lives on today in many schools, colleges and institutes of advanced training throughout the subcontinent just as his example of self-sacrificing love continues to inspire his fellow Jesuits. Founded in 1940, St. Xavier’s is meant primarily for Catholics but is open to all, irrespective of religion, caste or community who would be trained to lead lives in keeping with the school motto For God and Country. Through the years it has built up a reputation for excellence in the education it imparts to boys/girls from in and around Patna. Its earnest intent is that the young men/women it prepares for the world may be able to distinguish themselves by their selfless service, a service inspired by the reality that as children of one Father we are all brothers and sisters responsible for one another. As an institution, St. Xavier’s continually strives to adapt itself to the needs and aspirations of the people among whom it works. Students will be admitted in as long as they show promise of becoming young men/women and citizens who will live up to the school’s aims and ideals.
